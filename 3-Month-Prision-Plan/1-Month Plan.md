# Supercomputing Engineer
San Francisco Compute Company
 About the job

About

We're the San Francisco Compute Company, and we're building the first real-time trading platform for compute resources. Over the next decade, we anticipate thousands of startups and labs will be training and serving large models. These organizations need substantial computing power, and we're creating a platform where that compute can be traded efficiently. Our success will enable companies to scale to tens of thousands of accelerators for hours at a time without building their own infrastructure. This breakthrough will dramatically expand access to large model training, making the most transformative technology of our era available to a far wider range of organizations.

The Role

ML training clusters are some of the most high performance computers on the planet. Even relatively small clusters would have been in the TOP500 5 years ago. Our supercomputing team is responsible for keeping our compute clusters running smoothly, monitoring hardware health, and fixing things when they go wrong. We believe strongly in automation — code is the only reliable way to manage hardware at scale. As we scale, this will become a more data-driven role, predicting failures before they happen. We’re a small team, so you’ll be spending time talking to customers as well.

About You

    You’ve managed at least one GPU training cluster in the past (ideally a cluster with >1k GPU’s but not required)
    You appreciate and value good documentation
    You deeply understand Linux, CUDA, NCCL, and Infiniband
    You enjoy creating large self-correcting systems that keep hardware humming

Nice to Haves

    Experience with Rust (our VM orchestrator is written in Rust)
    Experience with distributed storage systems (Weka, VAST, Ceph, etc.)
    Experience with HPC network architectures (eBGP, fat-tree, VXLAN, MCLAG, etc.)
    Experience with Linux virtualization (KVM, QEMU, libvirt, etc.)
    Experience with performance optimization of machine learning kernels

Benefits

Unlimited office book budget

You can buy as many books for the office as you want. You’re encouraged to spend time during the workday reading!

Generous equity grant

Team members are offered a competitive salary along with equity in the company

Retirement matching

We match 401(k) plans up to 4%

Medical, dental & vision

We offer competitive medical, dental, vision insurance for employees and dependents and cover 100% of premiums

Time off

We offer unlimited paid time off as well as 10+ observed holidays

Parental leave

We offer biological, adoptive, and foster parents paid time off to spend quality time with family

Daily lunch

We cover lunch daily for employees

Visa Sponsorships

Yes, we sponsor visas and work permits

roadmap x aom career section

if you have an open-source project that has lots of stars in
Github, then you should mention it. If you often write technical, research-like blogs
with many viewers, talk about them too.

Winning internationally recognized competitions can demonstrate your research potential. For example, participating in Math Olympiads is valuable if you want to pursue theoretical work, while winning ACM programming contests showcases your ability to “build” systems, such as software analysis.


be the underdog, be extremely famous for being cracked and play people around like a beyblade
Work experience at well-known research laboratories, such as Microsoft Research, can strengthen your application\
The most concrete evidence of research ability is having papers in reputable interna-
tional journals or conferences. Having published papers, especially at top venues, is
a sign that you have been successfully involved in research.
 Publications are never required for application; however, given the competitiveness of CS admissions, they can significantly strengthen your application and are becoming increasingly common. Applicants admitted to top schools, especially in popular fields such as machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), often have multiple first-authored papers at reputable venues.\




fashion elitist
build home minimal fashion wardrobe




In your Statement of Purpose (SOP), focus on demonstrating your research potential and support your claims with concrete evidence from your experiences, such as published papers. For instance, if you state that you have teaching experience, specify your role, such as being an undergraduate Teaching Assistant or mentoring juniors in clubs. If you mention working on a project, provide results, such as a paper you submitted (even if rejected CHI PAPER!!) or performance improvements achieved over the state of the art. Additionally, keep your SOP concise, limiting it to no more than two pages, with references included on a third page.

students with extracurricular activities, like contributing to well-known open-source projects. Tell me about hacking projects that you did for personal reasons rather than because it was required for class.

Create a web site that has links to all of your papers in English. Explain in your application that all of your papers can be found on your web site.


You can work alone or with a friend. Ask professors in your classes to tell
you about interesting open problems and new research (most professors en-
joy doing this). Ask them to tell you names of conference proceedings. For
example in my area (performance modeling of computer systems) a rele-
vant conference proceeding is Sigmetrics. Sit down and start reading these
proceedings. You will come across all sorts of interesting problems. Think
about how you can improve upon the solution proposed in the paper.


talk about how you can't excel at stuff unless you find it interesting like reading algorithm design book and switching field to systems in a way that you got rew as rewarded such as the conference


- study offline and online book for 1 hour 
- learn chess for 1 hour


get involved with dicedb community and do the stuff you said publicly you're gonna do in website and LinkedIn

On the Practical Life webpage, you will find practical information about living in Switzerland, such as housing, insurances or public transportation.

Working in your lab is important, but maintaining a social life is also essential. The associations on the EPFL campus that you might be interested in are briefly described on the Social Life webpage.

Maintaining a regular physical activity should also be one of your priorities during your PhD, so you will find information about the UNIL-EPFL Sports Center on the Sports webpage.

A lot of cultural events happen at and outside EPFL, you will find more details on the Culture webpage.

### There are lots of resources that you can read, review, and study to find a specific project idea with a clear scope. For example, you can use blog posts from engineering teams at high-tech companies: [Uber Engineering](https://eng.uber.com/), [The Netflix Tech Blog](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog), [Spotify Labs](https://labs.spotify.com/), [Meta](https://engineering.fb.com/), and many more.

AI competitions are great project ideas for non-CS students, e.g., [EvalAI](https://eval.ai/) hosts many interesting competitions with prizes suitable for students from all backgrounds, e.g., (i) [Open Catalyst Challenge](https://opencatalystproject.org/) for Chemical Engineering students; (ii) [Neural Latents Benchmark](https://neurallatents.github.io/) for Neuroscience students; (iii) [The Robotic Vision Challenges](https://nikosuenderhauf.github.io/roboticvisionchallenges/) for students interested in robotics.

Hackathons: e.g., [PyTorch Annual Hackathon 2021](https://pytorch2021.devpost.com/), [AWS BugBust](https://aws.amazon.com/bugbust/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)

Systematic study of open source ML Systems via (i) interview study (please make sure you design the interview study correctly before conducting the interviews) and/or (ii) Formulating interesting research questions about building ML systems, for example, contrasting testing practices for ML systems vs. traditional software systems, collecting data from software repositories, and systematically extracting info from these repositories that answers your research questions.

Topics related to Systems for ML or ML for Systems: There are many opportunities to develop an infrastructure to make the ML workflow faster, more efficient, reliable, dependable, etc. Please check out some of the work at [AISys lab](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/publications/).

And, in general, for any interesting ML systems project ideas, try [GitHub](https://github.com/NirantK/awesome-project-ideas), or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/search/?q=systems&restrict_sr=1).

The course project is an opportunity to apply what you have learned in class to a problem of your interest. Potential projects must have these two components:

- Machine Learning algorithm: Any ML model class including neural networks or any good old-fashioned ML/AI.
- Computer Systems: The project should have at least one computer systems component: (i) Platform: Embedded, Realtime, Cloud, IoT, Edge; (ii) Systems issues such as scalability, performance, reliability; (iii) On-device ML: e.g., TinyML, AI on Edge; (iv) Trustworthy AI: Bias, Fairness, Robustness, Privacy, Security, Explainability, Interpretability, Interoperability; (v) Robot Learning, any project that makes robots more intelligent!

Building on top of an open source ML system that you can find on GitHub, e.g., you can develop a tracking algorithm and develop a plugin for [DeepStream](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk)
