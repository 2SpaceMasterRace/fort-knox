# Mail 

1. Hey Hari -- This note is regarding your job application. Let me know a time that works for you here for a zoom meeting (earlier the better). Please make sure you have zoom installed with good internet connectivity, access to webcam, low-noise environment.
   
   If you've any questions, feel free to email back. Talk soon!

   Founder, DeepSource

2. Hari — As next steps, my colleague Srijan would like to have a technical conversation with you. Srijan — You have the context.  
   Off to you both! 
   --
   Jai Pradeesh
   Founder, DeepSource
   
3. Hey Hari,
   I’d love to have a chat and discuss more about things you’ve worked on, and your ideas on static analysis.
   Here's my schedular. Please select a time that works best for you. 
   Talk soon!
   --
   Best,
   Srijan
   
4. Hey Hari,  
   
   I just saw your email — apologies for the delay.  
   
   There’s nothing particularly specific I have planned, but since you have a solid background in Python, I’ll be covering some language internals to build on that foundation. Additionally, since your work will involve improving our Analyzers, we’ll delve into syntax trees and discuss some programming best practices that apply universally, regardless of the language.  
   
   Looking forward to our call too!  
   --
   Best,
   Srijan

# General Notes

- Under no circumstances you're gonna let them know you are doing masters
- Portray yourself as someone who loves working with systems and build cool things people love like GNU parallel (watch primetime video on it), that hacker news thread on the curl / scrummvm / bittorrent creator guy, etc
- **Don't forget to mention you want to start at march or as late as you possibly can -- FIND GOOD REASONS FOR IT BY SEARCHING IN REDDIT**

* Go over the Deepsource Bookmarks in Firefox
	[ ] Talk about what you've done in the past 6 months as your break after university 
		[ ] Learn conversational Spanish, Japanese, and German with help of learn in X hours like Archer -- and fine-tuning motorbikes like RX-100
		[ ] Get good at X -- post cyberpunk 2077, Warhammer and other cool things ig and create your own aesthetic 
		[ ] Play pokemon moon, cracking old-school video games like civilization, watching film-essays
	 [ ] Try AsahiLinux on a VM ++ Watch DOD talk from cppcon and the one from Andrew Kelley [ https://x.com/debasishg/status/1852008730210242794 ] + Roc compiler internals hacktoberfest yt channel

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Part 0: Pre-Requisites:

[   ] GESAFFELSTEIN - VIOL x Instagram accounts aesthetic
[   ] Install Zoom & Check for perfect connection
[   ] Ensure good internet connectivity with mobile data and wifi tested 
[   ] Setup Webcam and adjust everything according to panni's help
[   ] Lock everything down and prepare early by creating the perfect low-noise environment and having books by your side and phone in silent
[   ] Make sure laptop and phone and speakers is charged ++ have headphones and everything ready and pray to god and have enough time to get into the flow state

**[  ] P.S: Saturday and Sunday : Learn the fundamentals of they want enough to talk about it, Monday fully get into applications of it -- take notes and re-review them and practice out loud** 

x Learn Design patterns & Anti-patterns and whatever Deepsource addresses from that one website | watch uncle bob interview from theprimetime & other conference talks on it x aprit bayhani blog 
x Showcase how you want to build the best ever static analyzer tool ever 
x Be invested in the problem space, read as many papers as you can relevant to deepsource [ ask claude to simplify and explain every paper and how to implement them]
x Be unique in building things — uber, dropbox level engineering culture  -- quastor blogs
x python PL design -- conference and uni reading groups and academic conference talks 
x find static analysis and pl-design blogs (focus more on real world stuff)
x Find good source code, learn good practices and antipatters and tricks like that in hacker news
x get really good at behavioral questions and ask deeply about the technical culture and process

**[  ] Work Harder than everyone, know everything and be able to talk so well you sound calm like a natural**

# Have a solid background in Python -- cover language internals to build on that foundation
  
# How to improve our Analyzers -- delve into syntax trees and discuss some programming best practices that apply universally, regardless of the language
 
# Study their analyzers, see where they suck and read people's experience on using them and how you can subtly fix these kinda problems

[  ] Learn everything about static analysis through talks, hackernews x reddit x twitter and seal the deal on your expertise by talking about Memspect + IICT conference and your passion on buidling great tools

   [   ] Talk about select ideas on static analysis that can be useful for deepsource -- see who even uses this field and for what.

[   ] Watch deepsource talks, find use case of static analysis in the real world, how other companies use deepsource

[   ] Watch Deepsource videos in youtube and learn everything about the company 
	[ ] Have a good explanation of how you dealt with false positives with Memspect, showcase your passion for developer tooling and developer experience by watching theprimetime videos
	[   ] Go over Memspect internals and problem statement once again learning the fundamentals - go over AST vs IR for analysis comparison, get a crash course into compilers -- data analysis and escape analysis
		[] **Memspect [C, Rust, LLVM]: A cool static analysis framework for real- world C codebases. Focuses on fast and accurate memory debugging. Gained compiler internals knowledge. Started off as a final-year project and was presented at two separate conferences**
			[ ] Fast and efficient static analysis built from the ground up
			[ ] Implemented a data-flow analysis engine to perform taint analysis and performs reachability analysis to only report the ones that actually affect the user's codebase 
			[ ] Web-services for collecting metrics, tracing -- primeagen talks
			[ ] Static Analysis Framework for C | C, Rust, LLVM, Ratatui September 2024
				• Spearheaded the development of Memspect - a tiny, static analysis framework that enables easier memory debugging in C codebases.
				• Developed sophisticated memory analysis pipeline with real-time visualization and customization
				• Implementing escape analysis algorithms and interprocedural control flow tracking to detect hidden memory leaks in large programs.
				• Built high-performance debugging interface with automated memory snapshot analysis and enabling seamless integration into existing build pipelines.
	[ ] Pitch memspect as a open-ended research project and talk about it what made it challenging and how did you overcome those challenges
		[ ] Have a cool experience with Google and Nvidia and IIT guys talking about Memspect at the first edition of Innovations In Compiler Technology (IICT) in Bangalore -- cc: @compiler_tech
		[ ] Summarize and critique a static analysis paper you have read that you found interesting.
		[  ] Talk about your publication and talk will be hopefully released this month end
