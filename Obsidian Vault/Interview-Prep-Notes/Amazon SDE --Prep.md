TLE CP-31 Sheet
- Our entire CP training is divided into 4 Levels (or courses).
- Each level is a 12-14 weeks program consisting of 2-3 live classes every week.
- Each level comes with 100+ curated practice problems. We provide 2-3 curated practice problems daily from Monday to Friday based on the week's topics. Each practice problem comes with dedicated hints and a video solution.

How often are classes held each week?

- 2-3 classes per week in each level.

What are the timings of live lectures?

- Most of the classes are held on weekend in one of the two slots: 2-4 pm or 6-8 pm IST
- Some of the classes are held on weekdays at 8-10pm IST

What is the total number of problems in a course level?

- We provide a total of 100+ curated practice problems in each course level. Every day from Monday to Friday you will be provided with 2-3 curated practice problems.
- Along with this you get 3-4 bonus problems every week to challenge you further.

Which platform are the practice problems picked from?

- We pick up the most relevant problems for every topic, the platform is not really important.
- Most problems are picked from Codeforces, while some are picked from CSES problemset, Atcoder, and Leetcode.

What if I am not able to solve a practice problem?

- Read the problem and try to think of a solution for 40-60 minutes.
- Couldn't solve? Look at the 1st hint, think again for 15 minutes.
- Couldn't solve? Look at the 2nd hint, think again for 15 minutes.
- Still couldn't solve? Watch the dedicated video solution.
- Still couldn't solve? See the solution


I created an excel sheet that had three columns: problem name, explanation of my approach in words and explanation of the optimal solution in words. I also stopped trying to do as many problems as possible and took more time to review each problem. Some days I would spend more time reviewing the problem than I spent doing it.

Throughout the week, I tackle 1-2 new medium-level problems daily. On Saturdays, I review all the problems I worked on by reading each problem statement, recalling my approach, and comparing it to my submitted solution on LeetCode. This process focuses on visual memorization and rehearsing explanations, as if presenting to an interviewer, which has significantly improved my recall of strategies.

I also bookmark(screenshot) tricky problems on LeetCode. On the day of an interview, I review only my top bookmarked questions for quick reference. I avoid solving new problems on the interview day, using that time instead to relax and mentally prepare.

Watch NeetcodeIO streams.

The number of problems you solve is less important than your ability to recall solutions during the interview. Regular revision will help reinforce strategies and maintain a sense of calm.

But seriously having a notebook to write down important templates and patterns. And writing down problems I find extremely interesting and have similar patterns and application elsewhere

Not being ashamed of memorizing classic patterns and structures.

Leetcode type interviews are not like real world problems, so we should not waste time thinking or talking how we would solve that IRL, unless the interviewer ask.

Focus on deeply understanding questions rather than trying to solve as many as possible

Consistency. It needs to be an everyday thing. Like going to the gym.

My off days I'll do 2 problems (heavy work day, some sundays). My on days I'll do 5+.


Leetcode 30 minutes every day. Only 30 but every day, no excuses (birthday, Christmas, tired - doesn't matter). Low effort, long time. It worked though - a year later I could crack any medium with ease.

You should probably get in the habit of solving and writing code at the same time. Spending 10 min explaining an algo is an absolute waste of time, just give a high level vibe of what you're going for and start writing. Same with the brute force soln, just say "oh we can do XYZ but I presume we want a better runtime than that".

Agree on this. Having done the loop at Meta and Google I spent so much more time explaining the first time around and they do not give a shit beyond:

- state the approach (30s)
    
- catch issues with approach and revise (2 min)
    
- state expected big O for time and memory (1min)
    
- code two test cases (1min)
    
- code the algo (10min)
    
- walk through test case (3min) And repeat.
    
Use a time to gauge yourself

- [Grokking the Coding Interview](https://www.designgurus.io/course-play/grokking-the-coding-interview/doc/solution-contains-duplicate) was particularly helpful for one of the questions I encountered.
    
- [LeetCode’s Data Structure Crash Course](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leetcodes-interview-crash-course-data-structures-and-algorithms/) provided the foundation for solving two of the technical questions.
    
- I also subscribed to **LeetCode Premium** to access additional problems for targeted practice.
    
- The most valuable resource, in my opinion, was [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/), which helped me refine my skills and strategies.

# Advice for Onsite Interviews:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Read through the question carefully and ask clarifying questions to ensure you fully grasp the requirements. Do not jump straight into coding this will be an automatic fail even if you correctly solve the problem.
    
2. **Communicate Effectively**: Clearly explain your thought process as you work through the problem. Be prepared to answer follow-up questions from the interviewer.
    
3. **Time and Space Complexity**: Always consider and explain the time and space complexity of your solutions.
    
4. **Persevere Through Challenges**: It’s not necessary to excel at all technical questions to pass the interview. In my case, I performed very well on the first two questions but struggled with the last one. However, after receiving hints from my interviewer, I was able to develop a solution.
    

In summary, preparation, clear communication, and the ability to adapt to challenges were key to my success.


First pass, look at 100-200 questions and their solutions (dont bother with the 15 min rule) basically I found that the 15 mins were a waste because I sucked so hard

Second pass use your strategy, basically try for 15 mins to remember the solution if you can and then try and regurgitate it and understand why it works

Third pass, work on understanding the answers and work on adding wrinkles and seeing if you can see the patterns

Takes longer but works to build in the patterns all at once, also gives you a better feeling at the start since you probably would be beating yourself up for not knowing the answers in 15 mins

I really had to learn how I learn cause the old college exam strategy of cramming a week before did not work for the interviews cause the question bank and subject material was way too big.

Started off by reading relevant sections of CLRS to build a solid foundation of knowledge (I recommend Skienna’s Algorithm Design Manual these days as CLRS is a bit too academic with proofs for everything. Algorithm Design Manual is far more practical).

After that I started solving a bunch of Leetcode problems, maybe about 150, till I found myself solving most unseen mediums in under 20 mins. I always timed myself solving them and considered it a failure if I took longer than 20 mins to solve a problem (Meta’s standard). This worked and I eventually landed an L4 SDE role with Amazon.

Also, because of the solid foundation, I can usually prepare for interviews in a month or 2 of prep. Unfortunately, the actual work experience doesn’t maintain these skills, what a shocker…


CTCI too


Sure, everything before the lookup reference part of the book. Interview/ Leetcode questions can come from any of those sections.

The second part is supposed to be just a lookup guide to see if the problem you’re solving matches one of those in the book. 99.9% of algorithm problems are covered by that reference but it’s not necessary to read it.


Hey, Googler here who used to suck at leetcode and then got 9+ offers in my career including Snap, Amazon, top startups, etc. And I only did ~100 LC questions. Here are the key takeaways:

I can't stress enough how important it is for you to struggle and attempt to solve it on your own REALLY HARD before checking the solution. No, it is not a waste of time to spend more than 30mins on each problem. You will learn the most from being stuck, struggling, and then things clicking. I will go as far as to say, _a lot of advice you see on these subs are awful;_ the blind are leading the blind.

**Set your mindset to this**: the goal is to learn how to **problem solve**. _Memorizing solutions is not problem solving_. Problem solving when stuck is the signal what good interviewers look for. This is how I got into Google without solving every problem optimally.

I would set the hard cut-off to check the answer at 1hour. At 15min and 30mins, check one hint at a time on leetcode. If there's no hint, check the tagged topics (linked list, graph, etc) which is often a huge hint by itself. DON'T GIVE UP SO EASILY.

This is why I only did 100 LC. It took a lot of time to solve each one. The difference is that _I actually solved them myself;_ therefore, I learned first hand how to think from scratch to the optimal solution.

Not to say either of you is wrong, but rather to shine light on the fact that everyone has different learning styles.

For me, personally, found live-streaming my learning highly useful. Pretending having to explain my process to non-existent viewers served as a sort of rubber ducky. After 5-15 minutes, I’d study the solution, explain it in simple terms to my “viewers”, rinse wash and repeat.

Honestly, I would still do what the top comment said, just look and see the solutions of the first 200, learn patterns, learn built in tricks, then continue with this Google guy approach and bang my head against the desk for 1hr straight until I solve the problem. It is probably smt you ve seen already before, so the solution and the pattern is probably some there hidden inside your brain

My approach is:

- Neetcode 150, first round. Clear Anki list every 50 problems. (Second round)
    
- Solve daily problems from Anki list once finished the neetcode 150, this is my leetcode base.
    
- Do fundamentals and learn the 20-30 top SD designs
    
- Do LLD, OOP or whatever is need
    
- Prepare behaviourals
    
- Do leetcodes focused to companies

This is what worked for me, it might not work for other people. I focused on leetcode interview top 150 and grind 75. First I only did easies, then I did mediums. I prepped over a few different disjointed spurts before I started interviewing. I didn't look up solutions. I tried to solve every problem on my own. Sometimes I would spend 2 hours on a problem, not come up with anything, get sick of it and forget about it, maybe coming back weeks later.

In total, I solved something like 120 to 130 on my own. When I started getting interviews, I ramped up and did two things differently: (1) I started looking at solutions if I couldn't solve a new problem within an hour and (2) I re-did problems I'd done before. Again, if I couldn't remember or find the solution within an hour, I'd look at my old solution. Including ones for which I gave up and looked at the solution, I completed about 160 problems total. This got me good enough to pass technical rounds with multiple companies including FAANG.

There are some important caveats: (1) I studied very hard in university. I took honours discrete math II and DSA II. I feel those classes helped me a lot. Especially in DSA II, we went over things like dynamic programming, linear programming and a lot of graph algorithms. I also took number theory as an elective, which is helpful for some problems. (2) Before passing interviews, I bombed a couple. I bombed some OAs and also a couple live interviews. I feel that this helped me manage my stress in live situations.

I don't feel like I had a systematic way of breaking down problems or classes of problems, I didn't explicitly write out patterns or anything. I guess by just forcing myself to solve problems on my own and by redoing problems, I started to internalise the patterns and recognise them in new problems I hadn't seen before.

tl;dr: I studied very hard in school and took all the algorithm and algorithm-adjacent classes I could. I did ~130 leetcode easies and mediums (and a couple of hards) from interview top 150 and grind 75 without looking up solutions. To grind interview prep I re-did problems to commit them to memory and looked at solutions when I got stuck. I shat the bed in a few interviews, but then got better at it and started passing them.

This is what I do at the moment but I’m not sure if this is optimal, I guess not because I don’t learn much.

1. 15 minutes to think of the solution, (just drawing out everything etc)
    
2. 5 minutes to code the solution
    
3. If I don’t get it, I ask an AI to show me what’s wrong with my current approach and then I ask it for the optimal solution and make sure I understand.
    

That’s it really, but I still don’t seem to learn at times when I come across new questions it just seems hard again.


Recognizing the type of problem and an approach that could work is the way, because otherwise getting to the approach is going to eat your whole interview.

Phone Screen

Before starting my preparation, I was familiar with basic algorithms like DFS, BFS, and Topological Sort. While I understood how these algorithms worked, implementing them took me some time. Additionally, I was unfamiliar with over 50% of the Grind169 list. But I would say I was fairly confident on basics of DSA. 

- **How to get solution in algomonster ?** All solutions are free and searchable through google. However, to navigate quickly [https://algo.monster/liteproblems/{problem_number}](https://algo.monster/liteproblems/{problem_number}) replace the {problem_number} in url with the actual number on leetcode.
    
- I focused primarily on medium-level LeetCode problems, skipping many easy and all hard ones, to target those most likely to appear in interviews.
    
- By the time of the phone screen, I had reviewed the questions 3–4 times, focusing heavily on medium problems.

**Implementation Practice**:

- While I skipped some detailed implementations, I practiced key algorithms like DFS and BFS for graphs and trees.
    
- To save time troubleshooting bugs or missing test cases, I copied code into ChatGPT to identify errors and suggest fixes. This was particularly useful when my code was mostly correct but missed specific conditions.
    

**Challenges**:

- Although I was confident in brute force solutions, my implementations were often slow or buggy.
    
- In interviews, I sometimes froze when test cases failed, highlighting the need for more implementation practice under pressure.


**Interview Breakdown**  
Onsite interviews typically involve 30–40 minutes of solving problems, dry runs, follow-ups, and managing pressure. My goal was to implement common algorithms within 10–20 minutes—an initially unrealistic target.

**Implementation**

- Familiar with most Grind169 solutions, I focused on improving implementation efficiency.
    
- Adopted templates from AlgoMonster, identifying patterns for faster problem-solving.
    
- Reviewed Neetcode150 list for additional practice despite overlapping content.

**Spaced Repetition**

- Re-implemented questions to reinforce concepts, focusing on questions I hadn’t solved before.
    
- For questions I was confident about, I reviewed only solutions instead of re-implementing.
    
- Although I didn't complete all of Grind169, I implemented many problems and revised them by topic.
    
- Did few Leetcode Hard problems by attempting solutions independently, most of the time would view the solution along with the implementation details and then implement it myself. 
    

**Key Takeaways**

- Don’t memorize solutions—Google often asks unique problems. Focus on understanding the core type of problem. 
    
- With practice you learn the implementation of all the basic algorithms and this will help you think in pressure situation. 
    
- Practice builds retention and confidence.

   **Approach**:

- Watched videos at 2x speed to save time.
    
- Focused on optimized solutions instead of brute force after first few videos
    
- Learned to use templates, which helped generalize solutions across similar problems.
**Algomonster Templates**  
Link : [https://algo.monster/templates](https://algo.monster/templates)

- Understand templates throughly for common problem types (e.g., Two Pointers, Graphs).
    
- Create your own template if you like.
    
- In interviews, you just have to focus on the specific of the problem as you already know the template of most common algorithm
    
- Templates also helped me explain my approach clearly, as I knew the structure well.

# During the Interview

**Thinking Out Loud**

- I had this habbit of explaining the purpose of each variable in code.
    
- Walk the interviewer through my approach step-by-step (eg. which test case would a given `if` condition would eliminate) to showcase my thought process.
    

**Importance of Dry Runs**

- Interviews often don’t involve running code on a system instead we need to do a dry run. 
    
- If the code has an error, interviewer may provide a test case for manual evaluation.
    
- Take a small test case for dry run. (It is challenging when we have graph/trees/recursive)
    
- Take positive as well as negative test case
    
- While practising know some trivial test case like for graph/tree "no node", for array "empty list" , etc.
    

**How to Dry Run Effectively**

- Write a test case as a comment.
    
- Copy the code below the test case and step through it, explaining variable values and logic.
    
- In comments specify the value of the variable if you think it is important for that test case. 
    
- This method helps spot issues and aids the interviewer in taking notes.
    
- For next case again copy the code above and redo all the steps

# LLD Interview (Amazon)

**Link**: [https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question?currentPage=1&orderBy=most_votes&query=OOD&tag=amazon](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question?currentPage=1&orderBy=most_votes&query=OOD&tag=amazon)

**General Tips:**

- Many LLD problems can be approached as LRU or LFU cache challenges.
    
- Use a hashmap to store node references for efficient lookup (useful for the add method).
    
- Use a doubly linked list to remove nodes in O(1) time (useful for the remove method); treat it like a queue.
    

**Approach:**

1. Identify the essential classes first, without focusing on parameters.
    
2. Add additional classes as needed to implement design patterns.
    
3. Define constructors and method parameters while explaining the code.
    
4. Use abstract classes or interfaces for creating hierarchies and subtypes.
    
5. Strive for modular, maintainable code.
    

**Tips:**

- Review solutions in the LeetCode discussion section for ideas.
    
- Use ChatGPT to generate a skeleton, but don’t rely on it for full LLD design (it’s not ideal for comprehensive solutions).
    

**Commonly Used Design Patterns:**

1. Strategy Design Pattern
    
2. Factory Design Pattern
    

**Other Useful Design Patterns:**

1. Observer Design Pattern
    
2. Singleton Design Pattern
    

**Common Interview Questions:** (Note: Most solutions available online are comprehensive, but interviews typically ask simpler version of it)

- Design a Package Delivery System
    
- Design a Hotel Booking System
    
- Design a Parking Lot
    
- Design GoodReads
    
- Implement the Linux find Command
    
- Design a Chess Game
    

# Behavioural Interviews

**STAR method , basics of behavioural interview**  
**Link :** [https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/behavioral-interview/](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/behavioral-interview/)  

- Reviewed past experiences to cover all leadership principles for behavioural questions.
    
- Important to be thoroughly familiar with your experiences for detailed answers(Amazon had many followups).
    
- 5-6 strong examples covering all the leadership principal are sufficient.
    
- Prepare for negative situations as well (e.g., describe a time you missed a deadline).
